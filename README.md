## Description

Welcome to my Social Media Network API for week 17 homework for UCF Coding Bootcamp. This project is important to me because I'm aspiring to develop
my own social media platform someday. This API uses MongoDB for the database, Express.JS for handling the server, and Insomnia to test the routes.
