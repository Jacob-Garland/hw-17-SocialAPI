## Description

Welcome to my Social Media Network API for week 17 homework for UCF Coding Bootcamp. This project is important to me because I'm aspiring to develop
my own social media platform someday. This API uses MongoDB for the database, Express.JS for handling the server, and Insomnia to test the routes.

## Video Demo

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local computer and open the folder in VS Code. Then open a terminal window for the folder.
2. Run `npm install --save-dev` to install all required dependancies.
3. Run `npm run build` to compile the typescript into executable Javascript. NOTE: This step can be skipped if using step 1 of Usage.

## Usage

1. After installation, run `npm run start`.
2. Alternatively, run `npm run dev` instead after step 2 of installation.
3. Open Insomnia and connect to the port running the API on localhost.
